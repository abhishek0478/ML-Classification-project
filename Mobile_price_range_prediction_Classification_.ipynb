        "The mobile phone industry is highly competitive, and the price of a mobile phone is determined by various factors, including battery power, Bluetooth, camera quality, screen size, and more. In this context, a study was conducted to understand the factors influencing the price range of mobile phones. The study used a dataset containing around 21 variables to predict the price range of mobile phones, categorized as low, medium, high, and very high.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first step in the analysis involved DATA WRANGLING, where missing values were handled and unique values were checked. The study identified that 180 phones had pixel resolution height as 0 and two phones had screen width in cm as 0. The minimum value of px_height and sc_w should not be 0, as it does not make sense for a phone screen width or pixel height to be 0. Therefore, the study replaced these 0 values with the mean values, ensuring that no missing values were left in the dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the study performed EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA), which revealed that all category phones were distributed with equal price range. The analysis also indicated that battery capacity was positively correlated with the price range of mobile phones, and the distribution of battery capacity gradually increased with the price range. This suggested that consumers may be willing to pay more for a mobile phone with a higher battery capacity. The study found that almost half the devices had Bluetooth, and half did not.\n",
        "\n",
        "The scatter plot showed a clear positive correlation between RAM and price range, with the majority of the data points clustering towards the upper right corner. This indicated that as the price range increased, the amount of RAM in the device generally increased as well. The study also found that the count of devices with dual sim was increasing for the very high price range. Additionally, the distribution of primary camera megapixels across different target categories was relatively consistent, indicating that this feature may not significantly influence the price range of mobile phones.\n",
        "\n",
        "The analysis of the screen size distribution among different target categories indicated that there was not a significant difference in the distribution, suggesting that screen size may not be the sole driving factor in determining the target categories. However, this uniformity in distribution can be advantageous for predictive modeling, as it implies that screen size may not be a significant variable in differentiating between different target categories, allowing other features to play a more crucial role in determining the target categories. The study also found that mobile phones with higher price ranges tended to be lighter in weight compared to lower price range phones.\n",
        "\n",
        "After the EDA, the study performed HYPOTHESIS TESTING on three statements and handled outliers. The study identified that RAM, battery power, and pixel quality were the most significant factors affecting the price range of mobile phones. The study then performed FEATURE ENGINEERING and implemented Machine Learning Models such as LOGISTIC REGRESSION, RANDOM FOREST, and XGBoost. Based on the experiments, the study concluded that logistic regression and XGBoost algorithms with hyperparameter tuning yielded the best results in predicting the price range of mobile phones.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the study found that the mobile phones in the dataset were divided into four different price ranges, each having a similar number of elements. Additionally, the study found that approximately half of the devices had Bluetooth, while the other half did not. Furthermore, the study found that as the price range increased, there was a gradual increase in battery power, and RAM showed continuous growth from low-cost to very high-cost phones. Moreover, the study found that the costly phones tend to be lighter than the lower-priced ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "The study identified that RAM, battery power, and pixel quality were the most significant factors affecting the price range of mobile phones. Finally, the study found that logistic regression and XGBoost algorithms, coupled with hyperparameter tuning, provided the best performance in predicting the price range of mobile phones."

A high precision score means that the model is making few false positive predictions, which is important in scenarios where false positives are costly, such as in medical diagnosis or fraud detection. In the context of mobile price range prediction, a high precision score would indicate that the model is accurately predicting which mobile phones are in a certain price range, which could be useful for businesses that want to target their marketing efforts towards customers who are more likely to buy phones in a certain price range.\n",

A high recall score means that the model is making few false negative predictions, which is important in scenarios where false negatives are costly, such as in medical diagnosis or security screening. In the context of mobile price range prediction, a high recall score would indicate that the model is correctly identifying all mobile phones that belong in a certain price range, which could be useful for businesses that want to make sure they are not missing out on potential customers in a certain price range.\n",

In other words, it measures how accurate the positive predictions are. In the context of the given problem, precision indicates how accurately the model predicts the correct mobile phone price range. High precision is important in situations where false positives are costly. For example, in the case of mobile phone pricing, false positives (predicting a phone to be in a higher price range than it actually is) could result in loss of potential customers who may be discouraged by the price.\n",

It measures how well the model is able to identify all positive instances. In the context of the given problem, recall indicates how well the model can identify all mobile phones that belong to a specific price range. High recall is important when false negatives are costly. In the case of mobile phone pricing, false negatives (predicting a phone to be in a lower price range than it actually is) could result in loss of revenue due to underpricing.\n",

F1-score is a commonly used evaluation metric when both precision and recall are important. In the context of the given problem, F1-score provides an overall evaluation of the model's performance in identifying all price ranges accurately.\n",

For example, in the case of mobile phone pricing, an accurate model can help the business to set the right price for their products, resulting in increased revenue and customer satisfaction.\n"

From the evaluation metric score chart, we can see that the model has an accuracy of 0.80, which means that 80% of the predictions made by the model are correct. The precision for class 0 is 0.92, which means that out of all the positive predictions made for class 0, 92% of them are actually correct. The recall for class 1 is 0.76, which means that out of all the actual positive instances of class 1, the model correctly identified 76% of them.

Additionally, we found that approximately half of the devices have Bluetooth, while the other half do not. Furthermore, we noted that as the price range increases, there is a gradual increase in battery power, and RAM shows continuous growth from low-cost to very high-cost phones. Moreover, the costly phones tend to be lighter than the lower-priced ones.\n",

We also observed that RAM and battery power increase with the price range, and higher-priced phones tend to be lighter. Our experiments suggest that the most important factors affecting the price range of mobile phones are RAM, battery power, and pixel quality. Finally, we found that logistic regression and XGBoost algorithms, coupled with hyperparameter tuning, provide the best performance in predicting the price range of mobile phones."
